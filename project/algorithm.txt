Step 1: Filter outliers - Find good cameras
	% Should we loop over all images or only 1?
	1) MinimalCameraPose - get potential cameras
	2) Check the number of inliers each camera gives: 
		a) Loop over all the images and projet X
		b) Compare the error compared to x
		c) Inliers are those where the error is lower than a threshold
		Summary) inliers = X(||x-PX|| < threshold)
	
	3) Save the camera with most inliers, and the inliers


Step 2: Resectioning algorithm - Improve Camera
	1) Do LM, gauss newton, steepest descent or some shit from lecture 9.
